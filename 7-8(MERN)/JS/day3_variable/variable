JavaScript Variables

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data that your program can manipulate and reference. Here are some key concepts about variables:

=>Declaring Variables:

    ->var: Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value. It has function scope and is hoisted to the top of its function.

    ->let: Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value. Introduced in ES6.

    ->const: Declares a block-scoped, read-only constant. Introduced in ES6. The value cannot be reassigned.


    ==================================
    var x = 10;  // Function scoped
    let y = 20;  // Block scoped
    const z = 30; // Block scoped and read-only

    ===================================

=>Variable Naming Rules:

    ->Must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).

    ->Subsequent characters can include letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

    ->Case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different).
