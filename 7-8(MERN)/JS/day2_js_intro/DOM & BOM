==>Document Object Model (DOM):

  -The DOM is an API (Application Programming Interface) for manipulating HTML and XML documents.

  -It defines the logical structure of documents and provides a way to create, manipulate, or delete elements within the document.

  -When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the DOM is created. It represents the same HTML document but in a different format using objects.

  -With the DOM, webpages are represented in a structured hierarchy, allowing easy access and manipulation of tags, IDs, classes, attributes, and elements.

  -Common methods provided by the DOM include:
    -> getElementById(): Returns elements with a specific ID.

    -> getElementsByClassName(): Returns elements with specified class names.

    -> getElementsByName(): Returns elements by name.

    -> getElementsByTagName(): Returns elements by tag name.

    -> querySelector(): Returns the first element matching a CSS selector.

    -> querySelectorAll(): Returns a collection of child elements matching a CSS selector.

    Example: Fetching an image with a unique ID using getElementById():


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body style="text-align: center;">
    <div>
      <h1 style="color: green;">GeeksforGeeks</h1>
      <p>Click on the button to see the image</p>
      <img id="image">
    </div>
    <button type="button" onclick="show()" id="btnID">Show Image</button>
    <script>
      function show() {
        let image = document.getElementById("image");
        image.src = "url";
        
        document.getElementById("btnID").style.display = "none";
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

==================================


=> Browser Object Model (BOM):
  -The BOM refers to all the objects exposed by the web browser.
  -It allows JavaScript to interact with the browser itself.
  -BOM deals with everything outside the page, including the browser window and the desktop screen.
  -Common BOM objects include:
    ->navigator: Provides information about the browser.
    ->screen: Provides information about the user’s screen.
    ->location: Represents the current URL.
    ->history: Manages the browser’s history.
    ->document: Part of the BOM, it helps manipulate the content of the loaded page (HTML and CSS).
    
    In summary, while the DOM focuses on the document’s structure, the BOM deals with browser-specific features and controls.
